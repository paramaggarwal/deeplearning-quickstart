# deeplearning-quickstart
A quick-start into deep learning, classifying top-wear/bottom-wear from the Myntra catalog.

# Summary

1. Download 2000 images from the Myntra catalog.
2. Using only the ones that are either topwear/bottomwear, we train a network.
3. The network is a Convolutional Neural Network built using Keras.
4. We test the model on five random images from the catalog.

# Run

1. `brew cask install miniconda`
2. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. `source activate myntra`
4. `jupyter notebook Start.ipynb`
